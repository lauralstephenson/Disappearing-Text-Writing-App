This is a very simple disappearing text writing app used to teach typists to not stop typing, and to continually save their work. 
Just type as fast as you can. You can backspace and correct, but if you stop typing for five seconds, the screen will wipe iteslf.
I suggest saving constantly to be sure your work is saved. It is good for people new to typing, who want to increase their 
typing speed, or who want to remember to save their work (which does save into a text file). You can copy and paste the contents
of the text file into whatever word processing program you normally use, then delete your typing, not the file, for the next person!
